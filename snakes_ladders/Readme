Your task is to make a simple class called SnakesLadders.
The test cases will call the method play(die1, die2) independantly of the state of the game or the player turn.
The variables die1 and die2 are the die thrown in a turn and are both integers between 1 and 6.
The player will move the sum of die1 and die2.

RULES:
1.  There are two players and both start off the board on square 0.

2.  Player 1 starts and alternates with player 2.

3.  You follow the numbers up the board in order 1=>100

4.  If the value of both die are the same then that player will have another go.

5.  Climb up ladders. The ladders on the game board allow you to move upwards and get ahead faster.
If you land exactly on a square that shows an image of the bottom of a ladder,
then you may move the player all the way up to the square at the top of the ladder.

6.  Slide down snakes. Snakes move you back on the board because you have to slide down them.
If you land exactly at the top of a snake, slide move the player all the way to the square
at the bottom of the snake or chute.

7.  Land exactly on the last square to win. The first person to reach the highest square on the board wins.
But there's a twist! If you roll too high, your player "bounces" off the last square and moves back.
