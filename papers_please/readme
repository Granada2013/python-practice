Your task is to create a constructor function (or class) and a set of instance methods to perform the tasks
of the border checkpoint inspection officer. The methods you will need to create are as follow:

1). Method: receive_bulletin()
Each morning you are issued an official bulletin from the Ministry of Admission.
This bulletin will provide updates to regulations and procedures and the name of a wanted criminal.

The bulletin is provided in the form of a string. It may include one or more of the following:

Updates to the list of nations (comma-separated if more than one) whose citizens may enter (begins empty, before the first bulletin):
- example 1: Allow citizens of Obristan
- example 2: Deny citizens of Kolechia, Republia
Updates to required documents
- example 1: Foreigners require access permit
- example 2: Citizens of Arstotzka require ID card
- example 3: Workers require work pass
Updates to required vaccinations
- example 1: Citizens of Antegria, Republia, Obristan require polio vaccination
- example 2: Entrants no longer require tetanus vaccination
Update to a currently wanted criminal
- example 1: Wanted by the State: Hubert Popovic


2). Method: inspect()
Each day, a number of entrants line up outside the checkpoint inspection booth to gain passage into Arstotzka.
The inspect method will receive an object representing each entrant's set of identifying documents.
This object will contain zero or more properties which represent separate documents.
Each property will be a string value. These properties may include the following:
- passport
- ID_card (only issued to citizens of Arstotzka)
- access_permit
- work_pass
- grant_of_asylum
- certificate_of_vaccination
- diplomatic_authorization

The inspect method will return a result based on whether the entrant passes or fails inspection:

Conditions for passing inspection:
~ All required documents are present
~ There is no conflicting information across the provided documents
~ All documents are current (ie. none have expired) -- a document is considered expired if the expiration date is November 22, 1982 or earlier
~ The entrant is not a wanted criminal
~ If a certificate_of_vaccination is required and provided, it must list the required vaccination
~ If entrant is a foreigner, a grant_of_asylum or diplomatic_authorization are acceptable in lieu of an access_permit.
In the case where a diplomatic_authorization is used, it must include Arstotzka as one of the list of nations that can be accessed.

If the entrant PASSES inspection, the method should return one of the following string values:
- If the entrant is a citizen of Arstotzka: Glory to Arstotzka.
- If the entrant is a foreigner: Cause no trouble.

If the entrant FAILS the inspection due to expired or missing documents, or their certificate_of_vaccination does not include the necessary vaccinations,
return Entry denied: with the reason for denial appended.

If the entrant FAILS the inspection due to mismatching information between documents (causing suspicion of forgery)
or if they're a wanted criminal, return Detainment: with the reason for detainment appended.


NOTE: One wanted criminal will be specified in each daily bulletin, and must be detained when received for that day only.
For example, if an entrant on Day 20 has the same name as a criminal declared on Day 10, they are not to be detained for being a criminal.
Also, if any of an entrant's identifying documents include the name of that day's wanted criminal (in case of mismatched names across multiple documents),
they are assumed to be the wanted criminal.
